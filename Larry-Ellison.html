    <H1><B>Larry Ellison History</B></H1>
    <p>Lawrence Joseph Ellison (born August 17, 1944) is an American businessman and entrepreneur who cofounded software company Oracle Corporation. He was Oracle's chief executive officer from 1977 to 2014 and is now its chief technology officer and executive chairman.

        As of June 2024, he is the ninth-wealthiest person in the world, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of US$137 billion, and the fifth-wealthiest in the world according to Forbes, with an estimated net worth of $152 billion. Ellison is also known for his ownership of 98% of LƒÅna'i, the sixth-largest island in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
        <p><B>Early life and Education</B>Ellison was born on August 17, 1944, in New York City to Florence Spellman, an unwed Jewish mother. His biological father was an Italian American United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption. He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48.

            Ellison moved to Chicago's South Shore, then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother, Lillian Spellman Ellison, as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chosen the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.
            
            Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration. Ellison states: "While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff." Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.
            
            Ellison attended South Shore High School in Chicago and later was admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and was enrolled as a premed student. At the university, he was named science student of the year. He withdrew without taking final exams after his sophomore year because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending the summer of 1966 in California, he then attended the University of Chicago for one term, where he studied physics and mathematics and also first encountered computer design. He then moved to Berkeley, California, and began his career as a computer programmer for different companies.</p>

            <p><B>Summary</B> Ellison is the co-founder and CEO at Oracle Corporation. With an estimated net worth of $41 billion, he is a big decision maker in the tech world. With annual revenues of $37.1 billion last year, Oracle is one of the largest companies developing computer hardware systems and enterprise software products.</p>
